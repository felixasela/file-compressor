This repository contains a file compressor developed in Python using the Huffman algorithm and tested with the pytest library.

## Virtual environment
When used from within a virtual environment, common installation tools such as pip will install Python packages into a virtual environment without needing to be told to do so explicitly.

A virtual environment is created on top of an existing Python installation; only those packages installed explicitly in the virtual environment are available.

```shell
python -m venv venv-env
```

## Activate virtual environment
To activate the virtual environment, the following command is used.

```shell
source venv/Scripts/activate
```


## Dependecies
install dependencies with the next command.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
